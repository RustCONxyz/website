                These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and
                conditions of your use of the <a href="https://rustcon.xyz"
                    class="underline underline-offset-2">rustcon.xyz</a>
                website (“Website”), “RustCON” mobile application (“Mobile Application”)
                and any of their related products and services (collectively, “Services”).
                This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and
                this Website operator and Mobile Application developer (“Operator”, “we”,
                “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business
                or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind
                such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your”
                shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you
                do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement
                and may not access and use the Services. By accessing and using the Services,
                you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
                the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract
                between you and the Operator, even though it is electronic and is not physically
                signed by you, and it governs your use of the Services.
